# ANN
Artificial Neural Network for Hadwritten digit recognition
Classification is an important data mining technique with a wide range of applications to classify the various
types of data existing in almost all areas of our lives. In this study we are going to implement a handwritten
digit recognition application using the MNIST dataset. To solve this problem, we will be using a special type
of deep neural networks that is Artificial Neural Network. The key component to most Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) projects is understanding how the training actually happen, and being able to test the results
correctly in order to get the most out of the given dataset, to tune training parameters, and at the end,
achieving an efficient ANN model.
An existing article was utilized as the ground example to the structure used in the project [1]. First step was
to identify the main parts, starting with data normalization, defining the structure Artificial NN model, and
then training and testing it. Then by understanding every piece of code and highlighting tasks that are
handled by high-level functions to be replaced and reprogrammed (in particular functions and methods that
are defined by the keras module) and finally apply it to solve our problem. During the process, existing tools
were used, denoting numpy, and matplotlib (for plotting and testing).
